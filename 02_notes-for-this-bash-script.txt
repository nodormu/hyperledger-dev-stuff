Source URLs

Assumptions and Notes
1) this script is pretty straightforward and simple, it creates the needed directories from the tutorial and builds the simple-contract.go and main.go for you.
2) be SURE you put this script in the correct directory:  /path/to/your/fabric/scripts/fabric-samples
3) after you run the script, move it (or delete it) out of the /path/to/your/fabric/scripts/fabric-samples directory so it doesn't cause problems with future git requests to the hyperledger and go contract tutorial gits.
4) why do I do this? so I (or you) don't have to worry about trying to build it out and can focus on the jargon in the tutorial from the source URLs.
5) putting EOF in single quotes (cat <<'EOF' > simple-contract.go) preserves all the double quotes from the code example in the tutorial
6) assuming you know how to use linux CLI, chmod and chown as you need for your environment
7) then go to the "Testing your chaincode as a developer" section of https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-contract-api-go/blob/v1.2.2/tutorials/getting-started.md
